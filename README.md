# Click Assist (Booster) Mod for Minecraft 1.8.9

If you play with 6-7 CPS like me, this mod will be useful. Maybe there will be a Weave version soon.

## Isn't this cheating/unfair advantage?
Well, maybe. If you don't know how to aim, I don't think it's gonna work.

## Thanks
Thanks also to [nea89o](https://github.com/nea89o) for making the old modding possible with this [template](https://github.com/nea89o/Forge1.8.9Template).
